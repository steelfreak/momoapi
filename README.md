Basic Start


To create an API user in the MTN MoMo Developer API using Postman, youâ€™ll need to follow these steps. The request will include the headers `X-Reference-Id` and `Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key`, along with a JSON body containing `providerCallbackHost`.

### Step-by-Step Guide

### A. Generate: API-USER

#### 1\. Open Postman

Launch the Postman application on your computer.

#### 2\. Create a New Request

- Click on the **New** button or the **+** icon to open a new tab.
    
- Select **HTTP Request**.
    

#### 3\. Set the Request Method and URL

- Change the request method to **POST**.
    

Use Address: [https://sandbox.momodeveloper.mtn.com/v1_0/apiuser](https://sandbox.momodeveloper.mtn.com/v1_0/apiuser)

#### 4\. Add Headers

Click on the **Headers** tab and add the following key-value pairs:

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| X-Reference-Id | your-unique-reference-id |
| Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key | your-subscription-key |

Replace `your-unique-reference-id` and `your-subscription-key` with your actual values. an easier way to find one is here: [https://www.uuidgenerator.net/](https://www.uuidgenerator.net/)

#### 5\. Add the Request Body

Click on the **Body** tab and select **raw**. Then, set the format to **JSON**. Input the following JSON object:

``` json
{
    "providerCallbackHost": "string"
}

 ```

Replace `"string"` with the actual callback host you intend to use though it can still remain as is to avoid confusion.

#### 6\. Send the Request

- Review all the information you entered to ensure it's correct.
    
- Click the **Send** button.
    

#### 7\. Review the Response

- After sending the request, check the response section to see if your API user was created successfully.
    
- A successful response should return a status code of **201 Created** along with a response body containing details about the newly created API user.
